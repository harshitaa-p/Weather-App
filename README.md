## My Weather App
Welcome to my first-ever web project - the Weather App! This simple web application allows users to check the current weather conditions for any location. I developed this app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the RapidAPI's API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Features
Location Search: Users can enter a city name or location to get the current weather information.
Weather Details: The app displays essential weather details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
• Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
• Open the index.html file in your web browser.<br>
• Enter the name of the city or location you want to check the weather for in the search bar.<br>
• Press the "Search" button to fetch and display the weather information.<br>

## Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page.
CSS: Used for styling the app and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used to fetch data from the RapidAPI's weather API and dynamically update the content on the page.

## API Usage
I used the RapidAPI's weather API to retrieve weather data for different locations. The API provides real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Acknowledgments
I want to express my gratitude to the RapidAPI platform for providing the weather API used in this project. This project has been a great learning experience for me as my first web development project, and I'm excited to continue improving my skills. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions!
